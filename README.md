# Industrial_copper_modelling

The copper industry deals with data related to sales and pricing. However, this data may suffer from issues such as skewness and noisy data, which can affect the accuracy of manual predictions. Dealing with these challenges manually can be time-consuming and may not result in optimal pricing decisions. A machine learning regression model can address these issues by utilizing advanced techniques such as data normalization, feature scaling, and outlier detection, and leveraging algorithms that are robust to skewed and noisy data.

The steps involves the project are,

1. Explored skewness and fix the outliers in the dataset
2. Transformed the data and performed necessary cleaning and pre-processing steps
3. Built the ML Classification model which predicts Status: WON or LOST
4. Built the ML Regression model which predicts continuous variable ‘Selling_Price’
5. Created a streamlit page where you can insert each column value and you will get the Selling_Price predicted value or Status(Won/Lost)
